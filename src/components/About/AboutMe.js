        I'm a front-end developer who is fully committed to turning my hobby
        into a successful career. Although I have a degree in Law with Business
        Management, I've found my passion with coding and I'm certain that it's
        the career path I want to pursue. If I could change one thing about my
        past, I'd choose to study computer science at university instead!
        Despite this, I'm thankful for experiencing all of the trials and
        tribulations that come with being self-taught, as it has taught me how
        to be independent and find my own solutions to the problems that I
        encounter, making me a more competent developer as a result.

        I enjoy the constant learning that comes with being a web developer, and
        then leveraging what I learn to build bigger and better applications.
        Creating something out of nothing, solving complex problems and building
        practical applications are what I love most about web development.
